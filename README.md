#Project 1 pt-b: Aloha Site with some pizazz

Project 1 pt-b at RED was an extention built on top of [Project 1 pt-a](https://github.com/teeppope/Aloha-Apparel-v1). It brought to the table an introduction to jQuery, and the active web.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JQuery
  * Slick Slider Plugin
- GIT for version control

####Added Technologies
We had a chance to add, and improve upon our site, and I added the below to the project.

- SASS
  * Media Query Mixins
- Accessibility Features
  * Using Aria attributes
- Gulp for a Build Tool

##Meaningful Takeaways
Using the dynamic trio of HTML, CSS and jQuery, I was able to bring a new life to this project and add that level of engagement with potential users which might not have been there before with just the duo of HTML & CSS. Thankfully, having completed the responsive strech goal from pt-a of the Aloha Site, I was able to focus most of my attention to the new additions to the Site along with all of it's functionality.

Pt-b of the Aloha Homepage was a really big challenge in working to understand how javascript works and how to use jQuery within a website. Having never used either before, over coming this challenge took up much of my time and I had fierce determination to understand how things piece together with js/jquery. I tried my best to create the simpler scripts I used in my site from scratch--having much success with the Add to Cart function I implemented, and roughly writing half of the email subscribed alert logic myself. It was a roller coaster of emotions over-coming my initial frustration of being disappointed in myself for not understanding jQuery right away, but many google searches and perserverance prevailed, and I was able to finish all the goals of this project, including the strech goals.

- jQuery is tough to wrap your head around initially, but it'll come, and I look forward improving in this area.
- Sometimes your functions don't need to be as complicated as you might think. While writing the add to cart function of the homepage, I kept thinking I was missing a step to the function I had written, but after taking a break, and coming back to it, I realized I was trying to add TOO much to it, so I got rid of parts not needed and then it worked!
