On Making Project01a: Aloha Homepage

This project, while it appears easy on the surface, challenged me in numerous ways. I went into it thinking I was going to keep my code as "organized as possible" and "super sleek, using best practices", but that proved to be tricky as I am just learning the in's and out's of the web development world, so what may be "clean" to me, might not to you (but I tried gosh danggit)! 

I got the ball rolling.

For this project, I used the harmoneous combination of HTML5 & CSS3 to re-create provided mockups. I tried to approach structuring the HTML based off my previously gained knowledge of web design, breaking the page up into smaller relateable sections/groups. I then swoooooped in with CSS3 to add some pizazz to a lackluster Times New Roman driven page, slowly churning milk into butter (or a list of text/images into an actual website).

Along the track, there were many a hurdle, but nothing a little bit of googling and thorough copy editing couldn't solve!

Some Lessons I learned:

My First mistake: Not git init-ing my project website the sameday we learned git. I feel had I done this, it would have given me the opportunity to get more practice using git and the CLI, but also would have allowed me the opportunity to roll back (the rim to win) to previous better working situations within my code. This would have been really nice for such situations as when I was styling my subscription form a couple different times experimenting how/what worked best, and learning which attribute/value pairs did what.

My Second mistake: Coding for mobile first. JUST KIDDING, that could never be a mistake. Sure it took longer than just doing the basic homepage, but it was actually a great learning opportunity, one of which challenged my brain into structuring the page into logical style structures to work across all screen sizes, then adding just the specific larger screen sized styles when needed. 

Some things I would like to better understand moving forward; concepts I slowly, like, 75% came to grasp while coding this website:
- Using the class="container"/.container wombo combo. I picked up on it through readings, and by the time I wanted to apply it to my site, I found it broke quite a bit of my styling. I did my best to try and use it for sections to force the page to look like the design comps, but I don't think I used it as effective as I could have nor as consistent.
- Definitely still Floats. While I did take to google/youtube a fair amount to figure them out, I still feel as if I could understand them better. I feel like this will just come with practice and time, and many many more google searches when they do pop up!
- Lastly, I would just like to continue to get aquainted with the box model! 

Overall, the making of this project was enjoyable, challenging and really pushed my procrastination habbits to the limit. I shocked myself with the level of focus I put into creating this and I'm looking forward to feedback for ways to improve!
