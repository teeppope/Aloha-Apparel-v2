#On Making Project01b: Aloha Homepage + some jQuery + flexbox.

Part b of the Aloha Homepage was a really big challenge in working to understand how javascript works and how to use jQuery within a website. Having never used either before, over coming this challenge took up much of my time and determination to understand how things piece together with js/jquery. I tried my best to attempt to create the simpler scripts I used, having much success with the Add to Cart function I implemented, and roughly writing about half of my email subscribe logic myself. It was a roller coaster of emotions over coming my initial frustration of being disappointed in myself for not getting jQuery right away, but many google searches and perserverance prevailed, and I was able to finish all the goals of this project plus the strech goals.

Using the dynamic trio of HTML, CSS and jQuery, I was able to bring a new life to this project and add that level of engagement with potential users which might not have been there before with just the duo of HTML & CSS. Thankfully, having completed the responsive strech goal from part a of the Aloha Homepage, I was able to focus most of my attention to the new additions to the Homepage along with all of it's functionality.

Some Lessons I learned:

- jQuery is tough to wrap your head around, but it'll come, and I look forward improving in this area.
- Sometimes your functions don't need to be as complicated as you might think. While writing the add to cart function of the homepage, I kept thinking I was missing a step to the function I had written, but after taking a break, and coming back to it, I realized I was trying to add TOO much to it, so I got rid of parts not needed and then it worked!
- Commiting often after solving a problem feels great!

Moving forward:
- Unfortunately, I ran out of time to test my site in all browsers, and I hope to make this be one of the first things I work on when we are able to fix up our projects for our portfolio's.
- I would really like to create small programs to practice my javascript skillz.
- I look forward to adding behaviours to my future projects!
